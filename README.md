## DNS Scanner

DNS LookUp Scanner: A simple Python tool to find DNS Records.

### Types Of DNS Records

4 Types of DNS Records we need to scan:

(i) A Record Scan.
(ii) MX Record Scan.
(iii) AAAA Record Scan.
(iv) TXT Record Scan.

#### A Record 

An A record maps a domain name to the IP address (Version 4) of the computer hosting the domain. An A record is used to find the IP address of a computer connected to the internet from a name.
A Records are the simplest type of DNS records, and one of the primary records used in DNS servers.

#### MX Record

Mail Exchange (MX) records are DNS records that are necessary for delivering email to your address.
In simple DNS terms, an MX record is used to tell the world which mail servers accept incoming mail for your domain and where emails sent to your domain should be routed to. If your MX records are not pointed to the correct location, you will not receive email.

#### AAAA Record

The record AAAA (also quad-A record) specifies IPv6 address for given host. So it works the same way as the A record and the difference is the type of IP address.


#### TXT Record

A TXT record (short for text record) is a type of resource record in the Domain Name System (DNS) used to provide the ability to associate arbitrary text with a host or other name, such as human readable information about a server, network, data center, or other accounting information.
